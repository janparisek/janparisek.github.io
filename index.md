## MY NAME IS
# JAN PARISEK

## I'M PRETTY THRILLED ABOUT SOME THINGS
### Like electronics.
### And computers.
### And good design.

Hey there! My name is **Jan Parisek**. I'm currently studying Computer Science in Darmstadt. I spend my time thinking, studying or working on various projects. This site is one of them.

I've been fascinated by technology ever since I was young. Mechanics, electronic devices and computers have always peaked my interest. Components working together in unison to contribute to a greater good; everything with a purpose. It was mesmerizing.

Before that, I was working towards my apprenticeship as a certified Electronics Technician for Equipment and Systems. During my time at German company [Gepro GmbH](https://www.gepro-gmbh.de/) I had the opportunity to learn a lot about electronics, their history and a few more things. After finishing my apprenticeship, I decided to take what I had learned to the next level.

I hope to eventually contribute to projects that are as interesting to everyone as they were to me when I was smaller. Creating things is what I've been striving to do for my entire life.
